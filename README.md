## Purpose
* This is an initial commit to test the new 'Streamlit for Teams' service.
* The files here were produced from an earlier presentation.
* This is just to test the Streamlit service.

## The App: Portfolio Rebalancing based on MDP
* One approach to reduce risk when construcing an investment portfolio \
is __maximum diversification portfolio optimization__. In particular, this strategy maximizes \
a diversification ratio and does not take into account expected returns.

* The __diversification ratio__ is defined as the ratio of the weighted average \
of all the volatilites in the portfolio divided by the total portfolio volatility.

* This web app optimizes a portfolio of stocks, bonds, and gold at regular \
intervals.
